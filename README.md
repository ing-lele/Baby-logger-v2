# Baby-Logger-v2
This project logs baby's bodily functions and displays them on a webpage.
Many pediatricians recommend tracking your baby's feeding patterns, wet and dirty diapers to help know if he/she are eating enough - at least for the first few weeks. This is valuable information if there is a problem early on. The doctor can use this information to help with a diagnosis. Some parents track diapers and feedings for the first year, some parents do not track anything. There are several low tech ways to track diapers and feedings (paper or whiteboard) and increasingly there are apps to help with this. 
For the techy/geek parents, there are projects like this! :sunglasses:
